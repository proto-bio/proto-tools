## Overview

Metal3D is a deep-learning model that predicts where zinc ions bind in a protein structure, developed by the Laboratory of Computational Chemistry and Biochemistry at EPFL. Given a structure, it scores candidate metal-binding sites and returns the predicted zinc coordinates together with a per-site confidence. This toolkit runs Metal3D over one or more input structures, returning clustered metal-site probabilities, optional per-residue probabilities, and an annotated PDB containing the top predicted zinc site when it clears the reporting threshold.

## Background

Metal3D ([Dürr, Levy, and Rothlisberger, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-37870-6)) is a three-dimensional convolutional neural network for predicting zinc-ion locations in protein structures. Around each candidate metal-coordinating residue (such as histidine, cysteine, aspartate, and glutamate), it voxelizes the local atomic environment into a 16 Å cubic box at 0.5 Å resolution with eight physicochemical channels — among them hydrophobicity, aromaticity, metal-coordinating atoms, hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors, and charge. The network maps each voxelized environment to a per-voxel probability of zinc occupancy; these residue-centered densities are averaged onto a shared grid and clustered into discrete predicted sites, each with a confidence value. On experimental structures Metal3D recovers zinc positions to within 0.70 ± 0.64 Å of their crystallographic locations — the most accurate zinc-location predictor reported at the time of publication — and, because it reasons from local structure rather than sequence conservation, it remains accurate on proteins with few homologs in the Protein Data Bank.

Metal3D yields two complementary outputs used in protein engineering: a per-residue zinc density that feeds into design workflows, and a global zinc density suitable for annotating computationally predicted structures. The published model is trained solely on zinc sites from the Protein Data Bank, though the authors note that the same framework extends to other metals by retraining on the corresponding sites.

This toolkit defaults to the published checkpoint (`metal3d-original`) and additionally bundles two retrained variants from dEVA ([El Nesr et al., 2026](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2026.04.23.720277)), a multi-objective protein-design framework that uses Metal3D to score catalytic-metal coordination: `metal3d-cat` and `metal3d-clean`. These variants adopt a slightly modified network (4³ convolution kernels in place of the original 3³) and a wider grid-averaging radius; all three checkpoints are downloaded from the [dEVA repository](https://github.com/gelnesr/dEVA) during standalone setup.

## Tools

### Metal3D Prediction (`metal3d-prediction`)

Predicts metal-ion sites for one or more input protein structures. Each input can optionally include a `candidate_residues` selection keyed by chain identifier; when omitted, the standalone worker evaluates canonical metal-binding residue types across the protein.

#### Applications

This tool is appropriate for scoring enzyme-design proposals by predicted metal-site strength, checking whether a redesigned structure still supports a target metal pocket, and annotating likely zinc-site coordinates before downstream structural inspection.

#### Usage Tips

- **`model_checkpoint` (default `metal3d-original`) selects the network.** `metal3d-original` is the published Metal3D zinc model. `metal3d-cat` and `metal3d-clean` are dEVA's retrained variants on a modified architecture; choose `metal3d-cat` when scoring catalytic metal sites.
- **Pass `candidate_residues` when the pocket is known.** Candidate filtering reduces the scored residue set and returns per-residue probabilities for the configured pocket positions.
- **Tune `probability_threshold` for reporting, not model inference.** The model always produces grid probabilities; the threshold controls which clustered sites are returned and whether the top zinc site is appended to the annotated PDB.
- **Use persistent tool instances for repeated calls.** The worker keeps the selected checkpoint loaded when reused through `ToolInstance.persist_tool("metal3d")`.

These apply to every Metal3D tool in this toolkit (`metal3d-prediction`).

- **Structure inputs accept typed `Structure` objects or path / coordinate strings.** The wrapper writes PDB text to the standalone worker and remaps temporary PDB-safe chain identifiers back to the original chain identifiers in the returned residue probabilities.
- **Outputs are returned as typed metric objects.** Each result carries `pmetal`, a `found` flag, clustered `sites`, optional `residue_probabilities`, and an `annotated_structure`. JSON and PDB export are supported through the standard export interface.
