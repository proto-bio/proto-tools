# BindCraft Binder Design

End-to-end de novo design of functional protein binders against a target by directly back-propagating through AlphaFold2. BindCraft hallucinates a binder backbone + sequence with a frozen target template, refines the sequence with ProteinMPNN, validates the redesigned complex with AlphaFold2, and filters the result through a battery of PyRosetta interface metrics — yielding accepted binders that have shown experimental hit rates of 10-100% in the original paper, with no MSA, no high-throughput screening, and no curated structural starting point required.

## Overview

BindCraft is a one-shot binder-design pipeline that treats AlphaFold2 as a differentiable structure-predictor and runs gradient descent against a binder objective (interface contacts + interface pTM + pLDDT + helicity bias + radius of gyration + …) on the binder logits while keeping the target frozen. The hallucinated binder is then sequence-refined with ProteinMPNN (which reuses the hallucinated backbone but produces a more designable sequence), revalidated with AlphaFold2 multimer, relaxed with PyRosetta, and finally scored against a ~30-metric filter set (interface dG, ΔSASA, shape complementarity, hotspot RMSD, hydrophobicity fractions, hydrogen-bond counts, secondary-structure percentages, …) before being accepted.

In the binder-design landscape this is the leading "AF2-hallucination" approach. Compared to RFdiffusion-based pipelines it does not need an inverse-folding step on a separately diffused backbone, and compared to single-pass ColabDesign hallucination it adds the MPNN+AF2+PyRosetta filtering loop that drives the published hit rates. Compared to Germinal-style differentiable design (also exposed in proto-tools as `alphafold2-binder`) it is a full end-to-end pipeline rather than a single gradient step. The trade-off is wall-clock time: a single accepted design takes ~10-30 min on an H100, and a production campaign is hours to days.

**Use cases:**

- **One-off sample (smoke test / notebook demo).** Set `number_of_final_designs=1` and `max_trajectories=1` with tiny iteration counts (`soft_iterations=10`, `temporary_iterations=5`, `hard_iterations=2`, `greedy_iterations=2`). Returns a single design (or none) in ~10-30 min on an H100. Good for verifying installation, demos, and sanity-checking a target before investing compute.
- **Quick scan / methods exploration.** A handful of designs (5-20) with a moderate trajectory cap (50-100) and medium iteration counts. Lets you compare hotspots, length ranges, helicity biases, or filter-override strategies without waiting two days.
- **Production binder-design campaign.** Upstream defaults: `number_of_final_designs=100`, `max_trajectories=False` (unlimited), full iteration counts (75/45/5/15). Produces enough diverse accepted designs to triage and order for experimental validation.
- **Targeting a defined epitope.** Provide `target_hotspot_residues` to focus the binder against specific functional residues (active site, binding pocket, catalytic loop, etc.).
- **Beta-rich targets.** Set `optimise_beta=True` (the default) to add extra hallucination iterations and AF2 recycles when a generated trajectory is beta-heavy.

**When NOT to use BindCraft:**
- You already have a PDB-bound binder that just needs sequence redesign — use `proteinmpnn-sample` instead.
- You need an antibody (CDR-only redesign on a fixed framework) — use `alphafold2-binder` with the Germinal backend, or a dedicated Ig-design pipeline.
- Your target is very large (>2000 residues) — AF2 multimer memory will become the bottleneck before BindCraft does anything useful; trim the target to its binder-accessible domain first.
- You just want a backbone, not a sequence — use `rfdiffusion3-design`.

## Background

For non-biologists, the four ideas BindCraft chains together are:

1. **Differentiable structure prediction.** AlphaFold2 maps an amino-acid sequence to a 3D structure. Because the network is differentiable, you can ask "if I nudge each amino-acid logit a little bit, how does the predicted structure (and any function of it) change?" — and you get exact gradients from the computation graph. BindCraft frames binder design as gradient descent against a sum of structural losses (good interface contacts, low PAE across the interface, high pLDDT, target hotspots within reach, …) computed on the AF2 forward pass.
2. **Hallucination.** The above process — optimising input logits against a structural objective — is called "hallucination". It produces a sequence and a backbone that, *in AF2's view*, satisfy the objective. The risk is that the hallucinated sequence may be designed *for AF2 specifically* and not actually fold the way AF2 thinks it does in the lab.
3. **ProteinMPNN refinement.** To mitigate that risk, BindCraft hands the hallucinated backbone to ProteinMPNN, an inverse-folding model trained to produce sequences that physically fold into a given backbone. The interface residues that contact the target are typically held fixed (`mpnn_fix_interface=True`); the rest of the binder is redesigned for foldability. Several MPNN sequences are sampled per trajectory.
4. **PyRosetta filtering.** Each MPNN-refined sequence is repredicted by AF2 multimer, the resulting complex is relaxed with PyRosetta, and a battery of physics-/geometry-based interface metrics (Rosetta dG, ΔSASA, shape complementarity, hotspot RMSD, hydrogen-bond satisfaction, …) is computed. A design is "accepted" only if it passes the upstream default filter thresholds (or your overrides).

## Tool Catalog

| Tool key | Operation | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bindcraft-design` | Full pipeline | Target PDB + chain(s) + hotspots + binder length range | List of accepted binder designs (sequence + relaxed complex + per-design metrics) |

## Execution Modes

| Mode | `number_of_final_designs` | `max_trajectories` | Iteration counts (soft/temp/hard/greedy) | Runtime (H100) | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| One-off sample | 1 | 1 | 10/5/2/2 | ~10-30 min | Notebook demo, smoke test, target sanity check |
| Quick scan | 5 | 50 | 40/20/3/8 | ~2-4 h | Methods exploration, hotspot/length sweep |
| Production | 100 (default) | `False` (unlimited, default) | 75/45/5/15 (upstream defaults) | ~24-72 h | Real binder-design campaign |

GPU memory: AF2 multimer needs ~32-40 GB minimum and benefits from 80 GB for binders/targets in the 200-500 residue range. The pipeline is sequential per trajectory (`devices_per_instance=1`) — to parallelise across GPUs, run multiple `bindcraft-design` instances concurrently via `ToolPool`.

## How It Works

The pipeline is four stages per trajectory; trajectories are launched repeatedly until either `number_of_final_designs` accepted designs accumulate or `max_trajectories` is reached.

**Stage 1 — AF2 hallucination (4-stage default).** A binder of random length within `binder_lengths` is initialised with random logits, anchored next to the frozen target with optional hotspot bias, and optimised against a weighted sum of structural losses (`weights_plddt`, `weights_pae_intra`, `weights_pae_inter`, `weights_con_intra`, `weights_con_inter`, `weights_helicity`, `weights_iptm`, `weights_rg`, `weights_termini_loss`). The optimisation runs in four sub-stages — soft (`soft_iterations`), temporary (`temporary_iterations`), hard (`hard_iterations`), and greedy (`greedy_iterations`) — gradually committing the relaxed logits to discrete amino acids. `design_algorithm` selects which stages run (`"4stage"`, `"3stage"`, `"2stage"`, `"greedy"`, `"mcmc"`).

**Stage 2 — ProteinMPNN refinement.** The hallucinated binder backbone is handed to ProteinMPNN (`mpnn_weights="soluble"` by default) which samples `num_seqs` sequences at temperature `sampling_temp`. Interface residues are held fixed when `mpnn_fix_interface=True` so MPNN only redesigns the binder core/surface. The top `max_mpnn_sequences` are advanced.

**Stage 3 — AF2 validation.** Each MPNN-refined complex is repredicted by AF2 multimer with `num_recycles_validation` recycles (or the optimised-beta variants if the trajectory was beta-heavy). This is the honest test: AF2 was not trained on this sequence, so high pLDDT/iPTM/low interface PAE here is a real signal.

**Stage 4 — PyRosetta scoring & filter check.** The validated complex is relaxed with PyRosetta and scored on ~30 interface metrics (`BindCraftMetrics`). A design is *accepted* iff every metric passes the corresponding entry of the upstream `default_filters.json` (or your overrides via `filter_overrides`). Accepted designs are appended to `BindCraftOutput.designs`; trajectories that fail any filter are rejected and a new trajectory is launched.

## Input Parameters

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `target_pdb` | `str` | *required* | Target structure (file path or PDB-format string). |
| `target_chain` | `str` | `"A"` | Chain ID(s) of the frozen target (comma-separated for multi-chain). |
| `target_hotspot_residues` | `str \| None` | `None` | Comma-separated 1-indexed residue positions on the target the binder must contact. Supports ranges (e.g. `"1-10,56,78"`). `None` = unrestricted. |
| `binder_lengths` | `tuple[int, int]` | `(65, 150)` | `(min, max)` binder length range. |

## Configuration

`BindCraftConfig` exposes 51 of upstream's 61 advanced settings as typed fields. The other 10 — animations / loss-curve plots / MPNN FASTAs / trajectory pickles / zip archives / intermediate-PDB cleanup, plus the `sample_models` debug flag — are hardcoded in the dispatch payload (`_HARDCODED_INTERNAL_SETTINGS`) because proto-tools only returns accepted designs (sequence + relaxed structure + metrics) and never surfaces those scratch artifacts to the caller. User-facing defaults are byte-for-byte equal to upstream's `default_4stage_multimer.json` at the pinned commit (`7cd4ace1b7407adf66a50dfefa47de2270f5e4a9`); both invariants are guarded by tests. Many fields use `depends_on` so the client hides knobs that the current `design_algorithm` / `enable_mpnn` / `optimise_beta` / loss-toggle / rejection-check setting renders inert. `device`, `seed`, `verbose`, and `timeout` are inherited from `BaseConfig`.

## Interpreting Results

The upstream `default_filters.json` thresholds reflect what the BindCraft authors found correlates with experimental hits. Useful rules of thumb derived from the paper:

| Metric | "Good" | "Excellent" | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `avg_plddt` | > 0.80 | > 0.85 | Whole-complex confidence; designs accepted at default filters typically clear 0.80. |
| `avg_iptm` | > 0.50 | > 0.70 | Headline metric. The paper shows hit rate climbs steeply above ~0.55. |
| `avg_iplddt` | > 0.70 | > 0.80 | Binder-side interface confidence. |
| `dG` | < -25 REU | < -40 REU | More-negative is better; depends on interface size. |
| `dG_per_dSASA` | < -0.010 | < -0.015 | Energy per unit area; size-independent. |
| `shape_complementarity` | > 0.55 | > 0.65 | Lawrence-Colman; >0.65 is rare but correlates with strong binders. |
| `hotspot_rmsd` | < 5 Å | < 3 Å | Did the binder actually find the hotspot you specified? |
| `n_interface_unsat_hbonds` | < 4 | < 2 | Buried unsatisfied H-bonds penalise stability. |

A *single accepted design* already passed every default filter — the metrics above describe how to rank/triage among accepted designs when ordering for experimental validation. If you're seeing zero accepted designs across many trajectories, relax the filters (see `filter_overrides`) before increasing iteration counts; the design loop is working but the gating is too strict for your target.

## Quick Start Examples

The same import block is used in all three examples:

```python
from proto_tools.tools.structure_design.bindcraft import (
    BindCraftConfig,
    BindCraftInput,
    run_bindcraft_design,
)
```

**Example 1 — One-off sample (~10-30 min on H100)**

Use this to verify the install and sanity-check a target. Tiny iteration counts and a single trajectory keep wall-clock down; expect either one design or none.

```python
inputs = BindCraftInput(
    target_pdb="path/to/target.pdb",        # e.g. PD-L1 from PDB 4ZQK, chain A
    target_chain="A",
    target_hotspot_residues="56",            # PD-L1 Y56 sits in the PD-1 binding face
    binder_lengths=(60, 70),
    binder_name="quick_test",
    number_of_final_designs=1,                # binder is always assigned chain B (upstream invariant)
)
config = BindCraftConfig(
    max_trajectories=1,
    soft_iterations=10,
    temporary_iterations=5,
    hard_iterations=2,
    greedy_iterations=2,
    num_seqs=2,
    max_mpnn_sequences=1,
    seed=42,
)

result = run_bindcraft_design(inputs, config)
print(result.designs[0].binder_sequence if result.designs else "no design accepted")
```

**Example 2 — Quick scan with a custom filter override**

A 5-design exploration with the iPTM threshold relaxed (handy if your target is hard and the default 0.55 floor never fires). `filter_overrides` only lists the keys you want to change; everything else inherits from upstream `default_filters.json`.

```python
inputs = BindCraftInput(
    target_pdb="path/to/4zqk.pdb",
    target_chain="A",
    target_hotspot_residues="54-67",         # PD-L1 residues forming the PD-1 contact patch

**Example 3 — Production run with custom hotspots and beta-optimisation**

The default 100-design / unlimited-trajectory production setup, with explicit beta-optimisation for a beta-rich target (e.g. an Ig fold). Expect ~24-72h on a single H100.

```python
inputs = BindCraftInput(
    target_pdb="path/to/4zqk.pdb",
    target_chain="A",
    target_hotspot_residues="54-67,113-123", # multiple hotspot patches
    binder_lengths=(80, 150),
    binder_name="pdl1_production",
    number_of_final_designs=100,             # upstream default
)
config = BindCraftConfig(
    max_trajectories=False,                  # unlimited — let it run until 100 accepted
    optimise_beta=True,                      # bump recycles & iterations on beta-heavy trajectories
    optimise_beta_extra_soft=25,
    optimise_beta_extra_temp=15,
    weights_helicity=-0.3,                   # mild anti-helix bias (default)
    seed=12345,
)

result = run_bindcraft_design(inputs, config)
result.export("pdl1_production", export_path="out", file_format="pdb")  # → out/pdl1_production/{design}.pdb + stats.json
```

## Best Practices & Gotchas

- **Length range guidance.** Upstream's default is `[65, 150]`; that range is the typical sweet spot. Below ~50 you're effectively designing a peptide and the AF2-multimer signal weakens; above ~200 GPU memory and per-trajectory time blow up.
- **Hotspot picking.** Pick *functional* residues (active site, paratope contact, catalytic loop, allosteric pocket), not arbitrary surface residues. A poor hotspot list either gets ignored (binder lands elsewhere) or kills acceptance rate (binder can't satisfy the geometry).
- **Helicity bias.** The default `weights_helicity=-0.3` is a mild *anti*-helix bias (the upstream authors found AF2 over-produces α-helical bundles). Set it positive (e.g. `+0.3`) to *encourage* helices for helix-friendly targets; set it to `0` to let AF2 do whatever it wants. `random_helicity=True` randomises the sign per trajectory for diversity.
- **Beta-rich targets.** Leave `optimise_beta=True` (default) on; consider also bumping `optimise_beta_extra_soft` and `optimise_beta_extra_temp` to give beta-heavy trajectories more time to converge.
- **GPU memory.** AF2 multimer needs ~32-40 GB minimum and benefits from 80 GB for binders/targets in the 200-500 residue range. If you OOM on long binders, shrink `binder_lengths` first; PyTorch fragmentation on AF2 multimer is hard to recover without restart.
- **PyRosetta licensing.** PyRosetta is free for academic non-profit use only. Commercial users must obtain a separate license — see the upstream BindCraft repo's setup notice and the PyRosetta licensing page (https://els2.comotion.uw.edu/product/pyrosetta).
- **First-time setup.** Downloads ~5.5 GB of AF2 weights (shared with the `alphafold2` toolkit's weights cache) plus the ColabDesign + ProteinMPNN + BindCraft repos.
- **Filter overrides escape hatch.** The full upstream `default_filters.json` is ~200 keys covering every metric in `BindCraftMetrics` plus secondary-structure/composition gates. Only override the metrics you actually care about; values you don't list keep their upstream default. Use `{"threshold": value, "higher": True/False}` for scalar thresholds, or `null` to disable the filter entirely.
- **Acceptance-rate monitoring.** With `enable_rejection_check=True` (default), the run aborts early if the rolling acceptance rate drops below `acceptance_rate=0.01` after `start_monitoring=600` trajectories. Disable it (`enable_rejection_check=False`) for stubborn targets where you want to keep grinding.
- **`max_mpnn_sequences=2` is a CPU-time floor, not a quality cap.** Each MPNN-validated sequence triggers a full AF2 multimer prediction; bumping to 5-10 helps for hard targets but multiplies validation time per trajectory.
- **Caching.** The tool is registered with `cacheable=False` because per-trajectory randomness (and the unbounded `max_trajectories`) makes naive caching unsafe; rely on `seed` + `max_trajectories` for reproducibility instead.

## Related Tools

- **`alphafold2-binder`** — single-pass differentiable binder design (one ColabDesign forward+backward pass returning logit gradients). Use this when you want to drive an outer optimisation loop yourself; use BindCraft when you want the full hallucination + MPNN + AF2 + PyRosetta pipeline end-to-end.
- **`proteinmpnn-sample`** / **`proteinmpnn-score`** — ProteinMPNN as a standalone tool when you already have a backbone and want sequences (or want to score an existing sequence against a backbone).
- **`pyrosetta-interface-analyzer`** / **`pyrosetta-relax`** — PyRosetta interface scoring and FastRelax exposed as standalone tools, for re-scoring or relaxing complexes outside the BindCraft loop.
- **`rfdiffusion3-design`** — alternative diffusion-based binder backbone generation. Pair with `proteinmpnn-sample` and `alphafold2-prediction` for an RFD3-style pipeline; choose between this and BindCraft based on whether you trust diffusion priors or AF2 hallucination more for your target class.
