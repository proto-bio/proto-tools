## Overview

Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose [Biohub](https://biohub.ai)'s ESM C activations into a large, sparsely-active feature space that is easier to interpret than raw embeddings. This toolkit loads an ESM C backbone, attaches the SAEs trained against the layers you request, and returns the active features at every residue.

## Background

An SAE is trained to reconstruct a language model's internal activations through a bottleneck that permits only `k` active features per position out of a much larger codebook. The sparsity pressure pushes individual features toward single interpretable concepts, so a feature may correspond to a specific structural or functional property such as a zinc-binding site, a beta barrel, or a transmembrane helix. Biohub trained SAEs on ESM C using the TopK approach and used them to organize the ESM Atlas, a map of 6.8 billion proteins ([Biohub](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.06.03.729735)).

The SAEs were trained with two structural hyperparameters that set granularity. `k` fixes how many features are allowed to activate per residue, with lower values not able to reconstruct the activation as accurately — but higher values are harder to interpret, since a residue explained by 512 features is barely more legible than the dense embedding the SAE replaced. `k=64` is the balance Biohub trained across every layer. Additionally, the `codebook_size` of each SAE fixes how many features exist in total. Small codebooks group related concepts into one feature, for example a single metal-binding feature; large codebooks split that into dedicated zinc-finger, iron-sulfur, and calcium-binding features.

**Every combination of these is a separately trained model, not a runtime setting.** An SAE learns its dictionary against one backbone, one layer, one `k`, and one `codebook_size`, so those values are fixed in the weights. `model_checkpoint`, `sae_target`, `layers`, `k`, and `codebook_size` therefore act together as a selector: the tool composes them into a HuggingFace repo id and loads that SAE. Biohub published 97 such SAEs, and only some combinations exist, so the config rejects the ones that do not and names the valid alternatives.

## Tools

### ESM C SAE Features (`esmc-sae-features`)

Runs each sequence through the ESM C backbone once with SAEs attached to the requested layers, and returns the active codebook features at each residue, ordered by descending magnitude. Start and end tokens are stripped so positions align with the input sequence: `feature_indices[0]` holds the features for residue 1, and the `position` column of an exported CSV is 1-indexed, matching the rest of proto-tools.

#### Applications

Feature activations show which concepts the model recognizes at each residue, which supports interpreting what drives an embedding, locating functional sites without supervision, and comparing how proteins are represented internally. Because features are sparse and indexed, activations are directly comparable across proteins: within one SAE, a feature index always denotes the same learned concept. Indices are not comparable between different SAEs, including different layers of the same backbone, since each is trained separately and orders its codebook arbitrarily. The `ESMC-6B-sae-layer60-k64-codebook16384` SAE additionally has agent-generated natural-language descriptions for its codebook, available through the ESM Atlas.

#### Usage Tips

- **`layers` selects which activations are decomposed.** The default is the ~75%-depth layer Biohub sweeps (300M: 23, 600M: 27, 6B: 60), where representations transfer best to downstream tasks. Each extra layer adds a download and GPU memory.
- **`sae_target` picks what the SAE reads.** `hidden_states` (the default) decomposes the accumulated residual stream after a block, so features reflect everything the model has built up to that depth; it is what the ESM Atlas and the published feature descriptions use. `mlp_outputs` decomposes only that block's own MLP contribution before the residual add, which attributes a feature to one layer's computation. MLP-output SAEs are published only at `codebook_size=131072`.
- **`k` and `codebook_size` are only free at the sweep layer.** All-layer SAEs exist at `k=64` and one codebook size, so varying either requires `layers` to be exactly the sweep layer. The config rejects unpublished combinations and names the valid alternatives.
- **Only requested layers are downloaded, and layer size tracks `codebook_size`.** Each layer file holds an encoder and decoder of `d_model x codebook_size` weights, so a hidden-state layer is 0.13 GB on 300M and 0.34 GB on 6B, while an MLP-output layer (131072 codebook) is 1.0 GB and 2.7 GB respectively. Requesting every layer of the 6B MLP collection would pull roughly 217 GB; the tool logs a warning past 10 GB rather than refusing, since a deliberate multi-layer sweep is legitimate.
- **Rank features by normalized activation, not raw magnitude.** The largest raw activations belong to features that fire on nearly every protein and say little. Biohub's published statistics correct for this: `(activation / uniref90_max_activation) * uniref90_idf` scales a feature to [0, 1] and upweights rare ones. `describe_sae_features` in `helpers.py` returns both statistics alongside each feature's label, for the one SAE with published descriptions (`ESMC-6B-sae-layer60-k64-codebook16384`, which the 6B defaults resolve to).
- **Output size scales with `k` times sequence length.** Each residue carries `k` indices and `k` magnitudes, so a 300-residue protein at `k=64` yields 19,200 pairs per layer.

These apply to every ESM C SAE tool in this toolkit (`esmc-sae-features`).

- **This toolkit shares the Biohub `esm` environment with ESM C and ESM3.** All three use the `biohub_esm` env; installing any one installs it for all.
- **The backbone is loaded through Transformers, not the `esm` package.** The SAE API is defined on the Transformers ESM C model, so this toolkit loads `biohub/ESMC-300M` and siblings rather than the `esm`-package weights the `esmc` toolkit uses. Both repos hold the same parameters in different serializations, so using both toolkits downloads the backbone twice: 1.3 GB for 300M, 2.3 GB for 600M, 25.4 GB for 6B. This is deliberate — the SAEs are published and documented against the Transformers model, and reading the `esm`-package activations instead agrees on only about 99% of active features, which is the wrong trade for an interpretability tool.
- **`batch_size` controls memory usage.** Lower it if you run out of GPU memory. For repeated calls, use `ToolInstance.persist_tool("esmc_sae")` to keep the backbone and SAEs loaded between calls.
