## Overview

ESM3 is EvolutionaryScale's generative protein language model, trained jointly over sequence, structure, and function. This toolkit wraps the open `esm3_sm_open_v1` checkpoint to embed, sample masked positions in, and score supplied protein sequences.

## Background

In 2025, [Hayes et al.](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ads0018) introduced ESM3, a generative model from [EvolutionaryScale](https://www.evolutionaryscale.ai) that departs from the encoder-only design of the ESM-1/ESM-2 line. ESM3 is a masked generative transformer that represents a protein across three simultaneous tracks (amino-acid sequence, discrete structure tokens, and function annotation). Training masks spans across all three tracks, so a single model can be prompted with any combination of partial sequence, structure, and function and asked to complete the rest. The flagship 98B-parameter model (`esm3-large-2024-03`) is available through the [EvolutionaryScale Forge](https://forge.evolutionaryscale.ai) API under closed-beta access (also offered via AWS SageMaker); the publicly released open checkpoint, `esm3_sm_open_v1`, is the small 1.4B-parameter variant.

ESM3 is the multimodal successor to ESM-2 ([Lin et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ade2574)). Where ESM-2 is a sequence-only masked language model, ESM3 adds structure and function tracks and a generative objective. For pure sequence-embedding workloads ESM-2 remains lighter and faster; ESM3 is the choice when masked generative editing matters. This toolkit exposes only the sequence-track operations (embeddings, masked sampling, scoring) over supplied sequences.

## Tools

### ESM3 Embeddings (`esm3-embedding`)

Runs a single forward pass over ESM3 and mean-pools the per-residue hidden states into a fixed-length sequence descriptor. Per-position amino-acid logits are returned on request.

#### Applications

The mean-pooled embedding is a learned protein representation for downstream supervised tasks such as clustering, classification, and property regression, and powers similarity search through cosine similarity on the mean vector.

#### Usage Tips

- **`repr_layer` selects which transformer layer is mean-pooled.** The default `-1` returns the post-norm output of the last block (matching ESM-2/ESMC `-1` semantics); other indices select pre-norm per-block hidden states, captured via a forward hook because `ESM3.forward` discards them.
- **Per-position logits are large.** Enabling `return_logits` adds a per-position vocabulary-sized float tensor per sequence, dominating wall time and memory on long inputs. Leave it `False` unless the per-position distribution is needed.

### ESM3 Sampling (`esm3-sample`)

Selects positions via a configurable masking strategy, masks them, and resamples from ESM3's predicted distribution. `single_pass` fills every masked position in one forward pass; `iterative_refinement` dispatches to ESM3's native `batch_generate` for multi-round commitment. Positions can also be pre-masked directly with `_` in the input string, or a masking strategy can be used.

#### Applications

This tool drives guided point mutation, variant generation, and infilling at designable sites. Resampling masked positions from a protein language model is the core operation behind directed-evolution proposals and antibody affinity maturation. Which positions are resampled is set by the [masking strategy](https://github.com/evo-design/proto-tools/blob/main/proto_tools/transforms/masking/README.md); see its README for the available selection methods and tuning knobs.

#### Usage Tips

- **`iterative_refinement` produces more coherent joint samples than `single_pass`.** It runs ESM3's `batch_generate` over `num_steps` rounds (cosine or linear unmask schedule) instead of filling every mask independently in one pass; it is roughly `num_steps×` slower. Default to it when masking more than a handful of sites.
- **`masking_strategy` controls which positions get masked before sampling.** See the [masking strategy README](https://github.com/evo-design/proto-tools/blob/main/proto_tools/transforms/masking/README.md) for the available selection methods and tuning knobs. As an alternative to passing a strategy, pre-mask exact positions with `_` directly in the input string and the masking strategy is skipped entirely.
- **`temperature` scales the per-position logits before sampling.** Values of 0.5 to 0.7 yield conservative mutations close to the input; values above 1.0 broaden exploration of the model's distribution.

### ESM3 Scoring (`esm3-score`)

Computes masked-language-model pseudo-perplexity for each input sequence. Each position is masked individually and the model's log-probability of the true amino acid under bidirectional context is recorded, then aggregated into per-sequence log-likelihood, average log-likelihood, and perplexity.

#### Applications

ESM3 pseudo-perplexity is a fitness proxy for ranking variants, filtering generated sequences for naturalness, or comparing engineered constructs against wild type. The masked log-likelihood difference between wild-type and mutant residues is a zero-shot baseline for variant-effect prediction.

#### Usage Tips

- **Pseudo-perplexity is a relative score, not an absolute fitness.** It is measured against the model's training distribution and is sensitive to length, so it is most useful for comparing closely related sequences of similar length.
- **Ambiguous residues are excluded.** Perplexity is computed only over the 20 canonical amino acids; `X`, `B`, `Z`, and similar are dropped from both the log-likelihood sum and the position count.

These apply to every ESM3 tool in this toolkit (`esm3-embedding`, `esm3-sample`, `esm3-score`).

- **ESM3 is a gated model and requires a HuggingFace token.** The open checkpoint lives behind a gated HuggingFace repo ([EvolutionaryScale/esm3-sm-open-v1](https://huggingface.co/EvolutionaryScale/esm3-sm-open-v1)). Set the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable with an account that has accepted the model license, or every tool raises before loading.
- **One open checkpoint is available.** `esm3_sm_open_v1` is the only public open-weights checkpoint; larger ESM3 models are EvolutionaryScale API-only and not wrapped here.
- **ESM3 is larger than many ESM-2 variants.** For sequence-embedding-only workloads, smaller ESM-2 variants are faster; consider reaching for ESM3 when you want masked generative editing. This toolkit takes only amino-acid sequences as input and does not expose the structure or function tracks.
- **`batch_size` controls memory usage across the toolkit.** Lower it if you OOM; raise it for short-sequence throughput. For `esm3-score`, `batch_size` counts masked variants pooled across all input sequences rather than sequences themselves (each input contributes one masked variant per position).
