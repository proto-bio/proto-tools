# UniProt

## Overview

`uniprot-fetch` retrieves protein entries from UniProt by accession ID or by searching with target name and organism. It returns the protein sequence, gene names, PDB cross-references, and the full UniProt JSON record. This is a CPU-only tool that wraps the UniProt REST API.

## Background

**What does this tool measure/predict?**
[UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) (Universal Protein Resource) is the most comprehensive curated protein sequence and functional annotation database. It combines data from [Swiss-Prot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-Prot) (manually reviewed, ~570K entries) and [TrEMBL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UniProt#UniProtKB/TrEMBL) (computationally annotated, ~250M entries).

**Why is this important?**
- Protein design: retrieve reference sequences for target proteins before optimization
- Structural biology: find PDB structures linked to a protein of interest
- Functional annotation: access curated function descriptions, active sites, domains
- Comparative analysis: retrieve well-characterized homologs for benchmarking designed sequences
- Quality assessment: reviewed (Swiss-Prot) entries provide experimentally validated reference sequences

**Scientific foundation:**
UniProt integrates sequence data from [EMBL-Bank](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home), protein structures from [PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/), and curated annotations from expert biocurators. Swiss-Prot entries undergo manual review including experimental evidence attribution, cross-referencing to literature, and standardized functional annotation. The database is updated biweekly with new sequences and annotations from the scientific community.

## How It Works

**Method overview:**
The tool wraps the UniProt REST API with two modes:
1. **Direct lookup** (`uniprot_id` provided): Fetches the entry directly by accession from the UniProt API
2. **Name-based search** (`target_name` + `organism` provided): Searches UniProt using two query strategies (exact gene match, then broader gene+protein match), ranks results by review status and gene name match quality, and returns the best match

**Key assumptions:**
- Network access to api.uniprot.org is available
- UniProt accessions follow standard format (e.g., P04637, Q9Y6K9)
- For name-based search: at least one matching entry exists in UniProt

**Limitations:**
- Protein sequences only (no DNA, RNA, or small molecule data)
- Search quality depends on how well the gene/protein name matches UniProt nomenclature
- Rate-limited by UniProt API (typically generous, but burst queries may be throttled)

**Computational requirements:**
- **Hardware:** CPU only, network access required
- **Runtime:** 1-5 seconds per query (depends on network latency and UniProt API load)
- **Scalability:** Sequential queries; for batch retrieval, loop over accessions

## Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `uniprot_id` | `Optional[str]` | `None` | UniProt accession for direct entry lookup (e.g., "P04637") |
| `target_name` | `Optional[str]` | `None` | Gene or protein name for search (e.g., "TP53", "tumor protein p53") |
| `organism` | `Optional[str]` | `None` | Organism for search disambiguation (e.g., "Homo sapiens", "E. coli") |
| `prefer_pdb_crossref` | `bool` | `False` | When searching by name, prioritize entries that have linked PDB structures |
| `max_candidates` | `int` | `5` | Maximum number of search results to evaluate when ranking (1-25) |

**Validation rules:** Provide either `uniprot_id` (direct lookup) OR both `target_name` and `organism` (search mode). The validator enforces this.

## Configuration

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fields` | `list[str] \| None` | `None` | If set, restrict the UniProt API response to these fields. Default returns the full entry (~880 KB for human TP53). A targeted selection like `["accession", "sequence", "gene_names", "xref_pdb"]` shrinks the response to ~1 KB. See [UniProt return fields](https://www.uniprot.org/help/return_fields) for the full list. |

**When to set `fields`:** batch lookups where the full record is overkill, or any caller that only inspects typed Output fields and never touches `raw_entry`.

**Caveats:**
- Typed Output fields are populated only when the corresponding API field is included. If you set `fields=["accession"]`, only `output.accession` is populated; `output.sequence`, `output.gene_names`, etc. fall back to `None` / `[]`.
- The wrapper's search-mode ranker reads `gene_names`, `reviewed`, and `xref_pdb`. Excluding those while in search mode degrades ranking quality. If using search mode with `fields`, include at minimum `["accession", "gene_names", "reviewed", "xref_pdb"]`.

## Output Specification

```python
# Return type: UniProtFetchOutput
UniProtFetchOutput(
    accession: str,              # Primary UniProt accession (e.g., "P04637")
    sequence: Optional[str],     # Protein amino acid sequence
    length: Optional[int],       # Sequence length
    entry_type: Optional[str],   # Review status (Swiss-Prot vs TrEMBL)
    gene_names: List[str],       # Gene name symbols
    pdb_crossrefs: List[str],    # Linked PDB structure IDs
    source_url: str,             # UniProt entry URL
    raw_entry: Dict[str, Any],   # Complete UniProt JSON record
)
```

**Key output fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `accession` | `str` | Primary UniProt accession ID |
| `sequence` | `Optional[str]` | Full protein amino acid sequence |
| `length` | `Optional[int]` | Sequence length in amino acids |
| `entry_type` | `Optional[str]` | Review status: `"UniProtKB reviewed (Swiss-Prot)"` for curated entries, `"UniProtKB unreviewed (TrEMBL)"` for computationally annotated |
| `gene_names` | `List[str]` | Gene name symbols (e.g., `["TP53", "P53"]`) |
| `pdb_crossrefs` | `List[str]` | PDB IDs linked to this protein (e.g., `["1TUP", "2XWR"]`) |
| `raw_entry` | `Dict[str, Any]` | Complete UniProt JSON for advanced access (function annotations, cross-references, feature tables, etc.) |

**Supported export formats:** `json`

## Interpreting Results

**Entry quality indicators:**
- **Swiss-Prot (reviewed):** `entry_type` contains "reviewed": manually curated, experimentally validated. Highest quality; use as reference sequences.
- **TrEMBL (unreviewed):** `entry_type` contains "unreviewed": computationally annotated, not manually verified. Useful but verify critical annotations independently.

**PDB cross-references:**
- Non-empty `pdb_crossrefs` means experimental 3D structures exist for this protein
- Multiple PDB IDs may represent different conditions, ligand complexes, or resolution improvements
- Use `pdb-fetch-entry` to get metadata (method, resolution) for specific PDB IDs

**Interpreting edge cases:**
- Empty `pdb_crossrefs` does not mean the protein structure is unknown: it may have been predicted by AlphaFold2 (check the [AlphaFold DB](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/))
- Multiple gene names are common for well-studied proteins with historical nomenclature
- Very long `raw_entry` records contain rich functional annotation; explore `raw_entry["comments"]` for function, subcellular location, and disease associations

## Quick Start Examples

**Example 1: Fetch by accession**
```python
from proto_tools.tools.database_retrieval import (
    UniProtFetchConfig, UniProtFetchInput, run_uniprot_fetch,
)

# Fetch human TP53 by accession
inputs = UniProtFetchInput(uniprot_id="P04637")
output = run_uniprot_fetch(inputs, UniProtFetchConfig())

print(f"Accession: {output.accession}")
print(f"Gene names: {output.gene_names}")
print(f"Length: {output.length} aa")
print(f"Review status: {output.entry_type}")
print(f"PDB structures: {output.pdb_crossrefs[:5]}")
print(f"Sequence: {output.sequence[:50]}...")
```

**Example 2: Search by gene name and organism**
```python
from proto_tools.tools.database_retrieval import (
    UniProtFetchConfig, UniProtFetchInput, run_uniprot_fetch,
)

# Find Cas9 from S. pyogenes
inputs = UniProtFetchInput(
    target_name="Cas9",
    organism="Streptococcus pyogenes",
    prefer_pdb_crossref=True,  # Prioritize entries with linked PDB structures
)
output = run_uniprot_fetch(inputs, UniProtFetchConfig())

print(f"Found: {output.accession} ({output.gene_names})")
print(f"Length: {output.length} aa")
print(f"Available PDB structures: {output.pdb_crossrefs}")
```

**Example 3: Access advanced annotations from raw entry**
```python
from proto_tools.tools.database_retrieval import (
    UniProtFetchConfig, UniProtFetchInput, run_uniprot_fetch,
)

inputs = UniProtFetchInput(uniprot_id="P04637")
output = run_uniprot_fetch(inputs, UniProtFetchConfig())

# Explore function annotations
for comment in output.raw_entry.get("comments", []):
    if comment.get("commentType") == "FUNCTION":
        for text in comment.get("texts", []):
            print(f"Function: {text.get('value', '')[:200]}...")

# List all cross-referenced databases
xrefs = output.raw_entry.get("uniProtKBCrossReferences", [])
db_types = set(xref.get("database") for xref in xrefs)
print(f"Cross-referenced databases: {sorted(db_types)}")
```

**Example 4: Chained workflow -- gene symbol -> UniProt -> PDB structure**

A common an internal repo pattern: resolve a target by gene symbol, then pull experimental structures for design templates.

```python
from proto_tools.tools.database_retrieval import (
    PdbFetchConfig, PdbFetchEntryInput, PdbFetchFastaInput,
    UniProtFetchConfig, UniProtFetchInput,
    run_pdb_fetch_entry, run_pdb_fetch_fasta, run_uniprot_fetch,
)

# 1. Resolve TP53 by gene symbol; bias toward the reviewed Swiss-Prot entry
#    that carries PDB cross-references.
uniprot = run_uniprot_fetch(
    UniProtFetchInput(target_name="TP53", organism="Homo sapiens", prefer_pdb_crossref=True),
    UniProtFetchConfig(),
)
assert uniprot.accession == "P04637"
assert len(uniprot.pdb_crossrefs) > 0

# 2. Walk the PDB cross-refs and pull the first structure's metadata + chain FASTA.
first_pdb_id = uniprot.pdb_crossrefs[0]
pdb_meta = run_pdb_fetch_entry(PdbFetchEntryInput(pdb_id=first_pdb_id), PdbFetchConfig())
pdb_fasta = run_pdb_fetch_fasta(PdbFetchFastaInput(pdb_id=first_pdb_id), PdbFetchConfig())

print(f"UniProt {uniprot.accession} ({uniprot.length} aa) -> PDB {first_pdb_id}")
print(f"  method={pdb_meta.method}, resolution={pdb_meta.resolution} A")
print(f"  {len(pdb_fasta.chains)} chains; first chain length: {len(pdb_fasta.chains[0].sequence)}")
```

**Example 5: Chained workflow -- gene symbol -> UniProt -> AlphaFold DB structure**

When no experimental structure exists in the PDB (or when you want a complete monomer model rather than a partial chain), pull the AlphaFold DB prediction. Same gene-name resolver, different downstream fetch.

```python
from proto_tools.tools.database_retrieval import (
    AlphaFoldDBFetchConfig, AlphaFoldDBFetchInput,
    UniProtFetchConfig, UniProtFetchInput,
    run_alphafold_db_fetch, run_uniprot_fetch,
)

# 1. Resolve gene symbol to a UniProt accession.
uniprot = run_uniprot_fetch(
    UniProtFetchInput(target_name="MLH1", organism="Homo sapiens"),
    UniProtFetchConfig(),
)

# 2. Fetch the AlphaFold prediction keyed on that accession.
afdb = run_alphafold_db_fetch(
    AlphaFoldDBFetchInput(uniprot_id=uniprot.accession),
    AlphaFoldDBFetchConfig(),
)

print(f"UniProt {uniprot.accession} ({uniprot.length} aa) -> AFDB {afdb.entry_id}")
print(f"  mean pLDDT: {afdb.mean_plddt:.1f}")
print(f"  per-residue pLDDT length: {len(afdb.structure.metrics['plddt_per_residue'])}")
```

## Best Practices & Gotchas

**Common mistakes:**
1. **Providing neither accession nor name+organism:** The validator requires either `uniprot_id` OR both `target_name` and `organism`. Providing only `target_name` without `organism` will fail.
2. **Using organism common names inconsistently:** UniProt accepts both scientific names ("Escherichia coli") and common names ("E. coli"), but scientific names give more precise results.
3. **Assuming all entries have PDB structures:** Many proteins lack experimental structures. Check `pdb_crossrefs` before attempting to fetch PDB data.
4. **Ignoring review status:** Swiss-Prot (reviewed) entries are manually curated and more reliable than TrEMBL (unreviewed) entries. Always check `entry_type` for critical applications.

**Tips for optimal results:**
- Set `prefer_pdb_crossref=True` when you need both sequence and structure information
- Use `raw_entry` for advanced use cases: it contains function annotations, disease associations, subcellular localization, active sites, and more
- For ambiguous gene names, increase `max_candidates` to evaluate more search results

**Edge cases to watch for:**
- Deprecated or merged accessions: UniProt may redirect to a new accession
- Isoforms: the primary sequence may not match all known isoforms; check `raw_entry` for isoform data
- Very common gene names (e.g., "kinase"): search may return unexpected results; be specific with organism

## Related Tools

**Tools often used together:**
- **`sequence-fetch`**: Multi-source orchestrator that resolves sequences from gene names across NCBI, UniProt, and PDB. Use when you want automatic database routing.
- **`pdb-fetch-entry`** / **`pdb-fetch-fasta`**: Fetch PDB metadata and chain sequences for PDB IDs found in `pdb_crossrefs` (Example 4).
- **`alphafold-db-fetch`**: Fetch AlphaFold-predicted structure keyed on the UniProt accession returned here (Example 5). Useful when no experimental structure exists.
- **`alphamissense-fetch`**: Per-residue saturation pathogenicity grid for the resolved accession; pair with the UniProt sequence to mask intolerant positions during variant design.
- **`blast-search`**: Search for homologs of a protein sequence retrieved from UniProt.

**Alternative tools (similar function):**
- **`ncbi-efetch`**: NCBI Entrez sequence retrieval. Broader scope (protein + nucleotide + gene) but less curated for proteins than UniProt.
- **`sequence-fetch`**: Higher-level orchestrator; use when you don't need UniProt-specific metadata.
