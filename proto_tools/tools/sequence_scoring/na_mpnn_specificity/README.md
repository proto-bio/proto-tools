## Overview

[NA-MPNN](https://github.com/akubaney/NA-MPNN) is a message-passing neural network for nucleic-acid sequence design and protein–DNA specificity prediction. Given a protein–DNA complex structure, the specificity mode predicts, for each DNA position, the base preference of the bound protein. This toolkit exposes that specificity prediction as a single tool that returns a canonical DNA-only position probability matrix (PPM) in `A,C,G,T` order.

## Background

Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins recognize their target sites through a combination of direct base contacts and indirect shape readout. Predicting the base preference a protein imposes at each position of a bound DNA site is central to engineering transcription factors, characterizing binding specificity, and designing synthetic regulatory elements such as repressors and promoters.

NA-MPNN ([Kubaney et al., 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.03.679414v2)) extends the inverse-folding message-passing architecture popularized by ProteinMPNN and LigandMPNN to nucleic acids, supporting RNA sequence design and protein–DNA specificity prediction from structure. In specificity mode, the model conditions on the full protein–DNA complex and emits per-position nucleotide probabilities over the DNA chains, which this toolkit canonicalizes into a DNA-only `L x 4` PPM together with the recovered true sequence and chain labels.

## Tools

### NA-MPNN Specificity (`na-mpnn-specificity`)

Predicts the DNA base preference of a bound protein from one or more protein–DNA complex structures. For each input PDB, the tool runs NA-MPNN specificity inference, restricts the output to valid DNA positions, and returns a canonical PPM (`L x 4`, `A,C,G,T` order), the recovered true DNA sequence (indices `0..3`), per-row masks, and chain labels. Each result is also written to a canonical `.npz` file whose path is returned in `output_npz_path`.

#### Applications

This tool is appropriate for scoring and ranking candidate protein–DNA binder designs by their predicted specificity, for comparing the base preference of a designed binder against a target motif inside an optimization loop, and for characterizing the specificity landscape of natural or engineered DNA-binding proteins. The per-position PPM can be compared to a desired motif to drive specificity-based selection.

#### Usage Tips

- **The tool needs a local NA-MPNN checkout and checkpoint.** Set `na_mpnn_repo_path` to a clone of the NA-MPNN repository and `checkpoint_path` to the specificity checkpoint (e.g. `s_70114.pt`); neither is auto-downloaded. A run that uses `device='cloud'` fails fast because these local resources cannot be staged.
- **`predicted_ppm` rows are DNA-only and renormalized.** Only positions that are both valid and DNA are kept, and each row is renormalized over `A,C,G,T`, so the returned matrix already excludes protein and masked positions.
- **`temperature` controls sampling sharpness.** Lower values (default `0.1`) concentrate probability on the most-preferred base; raise it to soften the distribution.
- **`output_directory` and `keep_intermediate` control artifacts.** Leave `output_directory` unset to write canonical `.npz` files to a temporary directory, or set it to persist them. Set `keep_intermediate=True` to retain the raw NA-MPNN output for debugging.

- NA-MPNN runs as an isolated standalone environment that shells out to the upstream NA-MPNN inference CLI; the heavy model dependencies stay out of the main environment.
- The specificity checkpoint is a locally provisioned asset. On a host without it, the tool's environment setup signals a clean test skip rather than a hard failure.
