## Overview

PARADE (Prediction And RAtional DEsign of mRNA UTRs) is a LegNet convolutional model for predicting cell-type-specific untranslated-region (UTR) activity and 3' UTR mRNA stability. This toolkit scores 5'/3' UTR sequences across the PARADE cell-line panel and predicts RNA/gDNA stability, using the checkpoints published with the paper.

## Background

PARADE ([Khoroshkin et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.31.630783)) is a generative framework for designing UTRs with tailored cell-type-specific activity. Its predictive core adapts the DREAM-challenge LegNet architecture: an EfficientNet-style convolutional network with squeeze-and-excite blocks that reads a one-hot UTR sequence plus a reading-frame positional channel and, for activity, broadcast cell-condition channels.

The activity models are trained per construct type — one for 5' UTRs and one for 3' UTRs — and condition on a panel of anonymized cell-line codes (`c1`, `c2`, `c4`, `c6`, `c17`, and, for 3' UTRs, `c13`), returning a predicted activity mass-center for each. A separate 3' UTR model predicts mRNA stability as an RNA/gDNA log-ratio. The featurization matches the upstream reference pipeline exactly, so predictions reproduce the published values.

## Tools

### PARADE UTR Activity (`parade-activity`)

Predicts cell-type-specific activity for one or more 5' or 3' UTR sequences, returning one value per requested cell code.

#### Applications

Use this tool to rank UTR designs by predicted activity, screen candidate UTRs for a target cell line, or quantify the activity differential between cell types for cell-type-specific mRNA design.

#### Usage Tips

- **Pick the construct type.** Set `construct_type` to `utr5` or `utr3`; it selects the matching checkpoint and cell-code panel.
- **Cell codes are panel-specific.** `c13` exists only for `utr3`. Leave `cell_types` empty to return the full panel for the construct type.
- **Match the training length.** Upstream trained the 5' UTR model on ~50-nt inserts and the 3' UTR model on ~240-nt (roughly 200–300 nt) inserts; the model accepts any length (adaptive pooling) but predictions are only meaningful near the training regime.
- **Mixed lengths batch together.** Different-length sequences in one call are batched per length group; RNA input (`U`) is accepted and mapped to `T`.

### PARADE mRNA Stability (`parade-stability`)

Predicts 3' UTR mRNA stability as an RNA/gDNA log-ratio for one or more sequences; higher is more stable.

#### Applications

Use this tool to rank 3' UTR designs by predicted mRNA stability or to pair stability with cell-type-specific activity when selecting UTRs for downstream validation.

#### Usage Tips

- **Stability has no cell conditioning.** The model returns a single log-ratio per sequence.
- **Use the training length.** Upstream trained this stability model on 186-nt sequences (its `seqsize`); score near that length. Mixed lengths in one call are batched per length group.
- **Higher is more stable.** The `log_ratio` output is directly comparable across candidates.

### PARADE UTR Activity Gradient (`parade-gradient`)

Computes a weighted differentiable UTR-activity objective and, by default, returns the gradient with respect to batched relaxed UTR logits.

#### Applications

Use this tool inside gradient-based UTR design loops (e.g. Fast SeqProp) to maximize activity in an on-target cell line while minimizing it in off-target cell lines. It is designed for optimizer calls rather than final biological validation.

#### Usage Tips

- **Logits are batched.** Pass logits with shape `B x L x 4` in `A,C,G,T` order; use `B=1` for a single candidate.
- **Terms target cell codes.** Each loss term names a `cell_type`, a `direction` (`max`/`min`), and a `weight`; all codes must be in the `construct_type` panel.
- **Soft/hard mixing controls relaxation.** `soft=1.0, hard=0.0` is fully soft; increasing `hard` uses a straight-through hard-forward estimator.

These apply to every PARADE tool in this toolkit (`parade-activity`, `parade-stability`, `parade-gradient`).

- **Runs on GPU or CPU.** The tools load a small PyTorch LegNet checkpoint; a GPU speeds up large batches but is not required.
- **Weights are provisioned automatically.** By default, the standalone worker downloads the published checkpoint from the pinned `autosome-ru/parade` commit into the managed model cache and verifies its MD5 checksum.
- **Predictions are faithful to the reference.** The vendored PARADE model/data modules are the verbatim upstream bodies (with only a provenance/Ruff header added per file), so the published checkpoints load and score exactly as they do upstream.
