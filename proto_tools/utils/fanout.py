    ``max_chunk_size`` items. Cost decides where a cut falls; count caps how wide it can get. A
    batch of uneven items otherwise splits into even counts of wildly different work, and the
    slowest span sets the wall clock.

    Cost can produce **more** pieces than counting alone: peeling an expensive item into its own
    span is the point, and the rest then packs behind it. Every piece still respects
    ``max_chunk_size``, and there are never more pieces than items. ``starmap`` queues pieces and
    reuses warm containers, so the extra ones cost dispatches rather than container starts.

    Spans stay contiguous and in order. The remote path derives a chunk's seed from where it starts
    and merges by concatenation, so reordering to balance further would cost both.

    Every span is computed from the whole batch's costs rather than from a running total, so the
    result does not depend on which end the batch is read from. An earlier attempt derived one
    chunk size from a prefix and applied it to the rest, which gave different splits for the same
