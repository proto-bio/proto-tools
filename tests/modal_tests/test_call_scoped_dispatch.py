"""A dispatch names its own Modal environment and client instead of publishing them.

``dispatch_to_modal`` used to write ``os.environ["MODAL_ENVIRONMENT"]`` and let Modal read it
back, which made the environment shared process state: two concurrent calls raced on it, and a
call had no way to name credentials at all. Both are now arguments.

One dispatch resolves three separate Modal objects — the service, the progress queue, and the
fingerprint volume — and the single ``os.environ`` write used to pin all three at once. Passing
the environment to only some of them splits a call across environments, so these check all three
together rather than the service alone.

Offline throughout: every Modal object is replaced, and clients are plain sentinels.
