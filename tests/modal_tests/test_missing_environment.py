"""A Modal environment that was never created says so, instead of reading as "not deployed".

Modal reports a missing environment and a missing app identically. Left undistinguished, a
workspace that has not run the one-time setup is told its tools are undeployed and sent to deploy
things that cannot land anywhere. The two need opposite actions, so they get separate errors.

proto-tools names the environment but does not create it: changing the shape of someone's Modal
workspace is theirs to decide, so the error offers the command rather than running it.
