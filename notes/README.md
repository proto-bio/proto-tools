# Notes

Team-shared development docs for proto-tools. These files capture tool-specific gotchas, setup guidance, and architecture decisions; knowledge that **every developer** needs.

For personal discoveries (debugging patterns, tool quirks found during a session), use Claude's auto-memory instead of adding to these files. Only add to notes/ when the knowledge benefits the whole team.

## Directory Structure

- `beta-welcome.md`: Onboarding for beta users and testers
- `error-handling.md`: `@tool` raise-vs-capture policy, `PROTO_CAPTURE_ERRORS`, `MissingAssetError` carve-out
- `logging.md`: worker logging architecture, status updates, verbosity control, third-party progress bar handling
- `runtime-api.md`: `ToolRegistry`, CLI, identifier resolution, docs extraction, schemas, JSON surfaces, gated weights, and calling tools
- `seeding.md`: seed management for stochastic tools, cache behavior with/without seeds, per-item RNG advancement
- `sherlock-setup.md`: Stanford Sherlock cluster-specific setup (temporary, for beta testers)
- `storage.md`: `PROTO_HOME`, `PROTO_MODEL_CACHE`, shared weights, per-tool overrides, storage layout
- `testing.md`: Test structure, assertions, markers, naming conventions
- `tool-environments.md`: standalone env setup, compute deps, GCC/nvcc, caches, binaries, `to_device()` protocol
- `model-taste.md`: expanded model/tool selection guidance for biological design classes, validator choice, model failure modes, and confidence labels

## Documentation

User-facing documentation reference pages are auto-generated from Python docstrings and field descriptions in the source code.

Developer reference docs live here in `notes/` as the canonical source for internal development guidance.

### Hiding sections from the public docs

A few Markdown sources here are published to the public docs site (docs.evodesign.org); `storage.md` is one. When a published file has a developer-only section that should not appear on the site, wrap it in HTML comment markers:

```markdown
<!-- docs:ignore start -->
## For tool authors
...content the docs site should not show...
<!-- docs:ignore end -->
```

The markers are invisible in the GitHub/IDE render, so the note still reads cleanly here, and the docs generator drops everything between them. See `storage.md` for a live example. The same markers work in toolkit `README.md` files. An unclosed marker fails the docs build.
